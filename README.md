I got tired of having to convert recipes from volume to weight measurements manually (check out [this article](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-measure-wet-dry-ingredients-for-baking-accurately-best-method#toc-measuring-by-weight-just-do-it) to see why I do that), so I made a simple utility website to do it for me!

Note that the converter has trouble with some ingredients, since I scraped ingredient densities from the King Arthur Flour website, and that data is pretty limited to ingredients that are used in King Arthur Flour recipes. I hope to find a more comprehensive database at some point, but until then most common ingredients should be detected correctly with some adjustment to the input recipe.
